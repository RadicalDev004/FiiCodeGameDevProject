//Description

  "Moon: Puzzles" is a MOBILE puzzles game based on the theme "Space adventure" for FiiCode Game Dev contest.
Embark on a moon-exploration journey with "Moon: Puzzles"!
You will encounter increasingly hard levels as you progress throughout the Moon map, collecting Stars
and facing difficulties. The game provides 3 skins you can acquire, based on your number of stars, none of these
giving an in-game advantage, purely being cosmetic.

  The premise of the game is simple, get to the flag! You are able to move Rocks but not Meteorites. Also
stepping over previously encountered tiles will lead to the loss of a Star. Want to make thing even more difficult?
Try grabbing the Star in the level to reach a Perfect score of 3 stars!
